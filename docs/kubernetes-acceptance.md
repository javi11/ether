# Reproduce the generated-media Kubernetes lab

This harness uses synthetic FFmpeg video/audio and lab-only credentials. It
starts the shipping Ether executable, PostgreSQL, a Newznab indexer fixture and
a real multipart yEnc NNTP service. Do not run it against production namespaces,
provider accounts or a claimed Plex server. Use the named `ether035-ha` kind
cluster and namespace. Fixture health is infrastructure readiness only.

The current integration implements the distributed specialist graphs. Historical
`a73b5c7a7` results showed local encoding and zero placement rows; those results
are baseline diagnostics, not evidence for current remote execution or recovery.
Pin the exact integration SHA/image for every new run. Never strip genuine
stream metadata to force a plan through an unsupported gate. The chart's mixed
public-role lab acknowledgement remains required.

## Start the isolated fixtures

Use `packaging/kubernetes/kind.yaml` for one control plane and two workers.
Build the exact reviewed runtime candidate with the repository Dockerfile,
checksum-verified `scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.sh linux-amd64` output, explicit amd64
platform and an OCI revision label. Load only that image into `ether035-ha`.
`source-fixture.yaml` currently names `ether035-ha:a73b5c7a7`; update its generator
image to your reviewed candidate. Do not use this staging tag as a release.

Prepare the lab PostgreSQL and Secret refs as described in `kubernetes.md`,
with newly generated test-only DB password, 32-byte raw encryption key and an
independent Ed25519 issuer. PostgreSQL must be a named lab fixture pod
`ether035-ha-pg-0` labeled `app=ether035-ha-pg`. A singleton is sufficient for
initial pipeline experiments and is not database HA. Keep database authority on
a surviving node for encoder-loss tests; a worker loss that also kills the only
database cannot prove database availability. Local-path PVCs do not move data
between nodes automatically.

Create the synthetic source:

```sh
kubectl -n ether035-ha create configmap ether035-ha-source-code \
  --from-file=packaging/kubernetes/source-fixture.py
kubectl -n ether035-ha apply -f packaging/kubernetes/source-fixture.yaml
kubectl -n ether035-ha rollout status deployment/ether035-ha-source
```

The init container generates 180 seconds of MPEG4 video and sine-wave AAC audio
into an emptyDir. The Python fixture publishes Newznab caps/search/NZB on 8080
and NNTP article bodies on 1190. It does **not** serve media over HTTP. Article
bodies use real multipart yEnc with per-part CRC32 and the final whole-file CRC.
The fixture is pinned to the control plane to survive worker process-loss tests.
`GET /stats` reports NZB grabs, NNTP body requests and bytes without logging API
keys or query strings. No upstream provider is contacted.

## Seed lab identity, metadata and sources

Port-forward a healthy full node's public listener to loopback:

```sh
kubectl -n ether035-ha port-forward pod/ether035-ether-full-1 18035:32400 \
  --address 127.0.0.1
```

In a second shell with the lab kubeconfig selected:

```sh
python3 packaging/kubernetes/seed-lab.py --base http://127.0.0.1:18035 \
  --credentials-dir /tmp/ether035-lab-private
```

The seed script requires the named kind context, namespace and PostgreSQL fixture
label. It creates a local owner through the shipping setup API, then configures
only the fixture NNTP provider and indexer through the owner config API. It
refuses claimed servers and nonfixture provider/indexer replacement. A detailed
synthetic catalog row is seeded directly in the isolated PG database because
there is no shipping title-create API; timestamps suppress upstream metadata
refresh. Rating key `1000000000900001` is `MovieKey(900001)`, not a raw TMDB ID.

The script issues a random short-lived local delegation by inserting only its
SHA256 into the shipping `auth_delegations` table, bound to the active lab viewer
with a 15-minute expiry. Its `ether-cast-` credential is accepted by Plex auth and
has no upstream account rights. Admin identity grants are **not** raw Plex
credentials. Private files contain the owner password, admin grant, playback
credential and request headers; keep them out of values, logs and artifacts.
Rerunning the seed refreshes the lab delegation without creating a Plex claim.

## Measure actual media and actual placement

Before another mixed-role media run, verify the controller's empty-backend
behavior separately: with an empty disposable media Service and a ready
disposable API backend under one test origin, both canonical media prefixes
must return 503 without reaching API, while browse/control paths still reach
API. The Traefik lab fixture enables `allowemptyservices` for this invariant.
Capture correlated controller/backend logs and exact resource UIDs; remove only
the disposable objects with UID preconditions afterward. Do not remove real
delivery endpoints or create a playback session for this routing check. This
check establishes routing behavior, not media availability or a readiness cause.

Use the real generated metadata and ordinary Plex transcode request:

```text
/library/metadata/1000000000900001
/video/:/transcode/universal/start.m3u8?path=%2Flibrary%2Fmetadata%2F1000000000900001&session=ether035-ha-generated-001&protocol=hls&directPlay=0&directStream=0&videoCodec=h264&audioCodec=aac&maxVideoBitrate=1000&videoResolution=640x360
```

Send the saved playback headers, then follow the returned playlists/segment URLs.
Store grant-bearing URLs only in a private probe config. Do not print the
playlist or token. The MPEG4 input requires a genuine H264 transcode; fetching a
source file or a direct-play response cannot substitute for that work.

For a fresh reviewed Plex attempt, use `plex-baseline.py` to own the complete
Start, authored HLS collection and normal Stop in one synchronous process. The
earlier separate collector workflow allowed setup after Start and a 161-second
gap before the first variant request. Its failed request proves neither media
delivery nor an expiry cause. Prepare collectors and review the private request
config before another attempt; never extend grants or idle policy to accommodate
collector setup.

The private config contains `session`, `requestID`, exact `startURL`/`stopURL`,
original `headers`, absolute pinned `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` paths and their SHA256
values in `ffmpegSHA256`/`ffprobeSHA256`. Keep the real original request/plan,
fixture and quality unchanged. Optional bounds are `durationSeconds` (5–30,
default30), `minimumSegments` (1–8, default5), `requestTimeoutSeconds` (1–10,
default5) and `maximumFirstGETDelaySeconds` (0.05–1, default1). The config must be
mode0600. Raw manifests, arguments, bodies and observer data remain private.

Exactly one `samplers` entry declares `name`, a Python `argv`, `scriptSHA256`
and `inputs` (absolute `path`/`sha256` pairs). Use the reviewed
`baseline-observer.py` with `--kubectl`, `--expected`, `--session`, `--request-id`,
`--ready-file {readyFile}` and `--output-dir {outputDir}`. Its expectation file
pins the four roles' node/boot/Pod UID/container/image tuples from the strict
allocation oracle, the held server's exact instance, and fixture/Ingress Pod
UIDs. The observer performs read-only checks, rejects an already allocated
session, verifies singleton API/media endpoints, captures source fixture counters
and observes encoder processes and durable placement. It emits readiness only
after initial checks. No source, provider, database policy or runtime control is
mutated. Its exact command, inputs and hashes need review with the attempt.

```sh
# Both commands below perform ZERO HTTP requests and start ZERO children.
python3 packaging/kubernetes/plex-baseline.py --config /tmp/attempt.private.json
python3 packaging/kubernetes/plex-baseline.py --config /tmp/attempt.private.json \
  --dry-parse-master /tmp/previous-master.private

# Separate authorization is required for one fresh session. Output must be new.
nice -n 10 python3 packaging/kubernetes/plex-baseline.py \
  --config /tmp/attempt.private.json --output /tmp/attempt-private-output --run
```

The live group starts the bounded observer and waits for readiness BEFORE its
only Start. It parses the returned master and immediately fetches the authored
variant without a tool/message roundtrip. Monotonic timestamps bracket the end
of the Start body read and the first media GET; a delay above the configured
bound aborts before sending that GET. It preserves authored queries, enforces
the same loopback transport origin/approved lab Host, refuses redirects and
stops on the first HTTP, protocol, packet or decoder failure. It collects at
most30 seconds of media, with a50-second collection wall bound; individual
requests, analysis children, observer setup and cleanup have separate finite
bounds. Every collected packet's PTS/DTS is retained and all audio/video tracks'
DTS must strictly increase across segments. Strict decoder exit is recorded
separately and does not prove decoded completeness.

Normal Stop runs in `finally`, even after an unknown Start outcome. The observer
then finishes its bounded read-only children and is reaped; a forced observer
cleanup or surviving process group fails the harness. Stop HTTP200 never sets
`retirementVerified`: independently check the actual source-preparation and
encoder/input/source retirement receipts before releasing any responsibility.
Likewise, collection does not prove placement, fencing, node-loss continuity or
native GPU execution. The offline check covers orchestration and failure paths
with stubs, without contacting the lab or claiming actual media acceptance.

`media-probe.py` accepts this private JSON config (replace the manifest URL with
the actual request/returned URL; header file is generated by the seed script):

```json
{
  "manifestURL": "http://127.0.0.1:18035/ACTUAL-MANIFEST-URL",
  "allowedOrigins": ["http://127.0.0.1:18035"],
  "headersFile": "/tmp/ether035-lab-private/playback-headers.json",
  "durationSeconds": 90,
  "maximumGapSeconds": 5,
  "minimumSegments": 10,
  "requestTimeoutSeconds": 5,
  "packetImage": "ether035-ha:YOUR-REVIEWED-CANDIDATE"
}
```

```sh
python3 packaging/kubernetes/media-probe.py --config /tmp/probe.private.json \
  --output /tmp/ether035-media-evidence
```

The collector fetches real clear MPEG-TS HLS, paces consumption at media duration,
records bytes, SHA256, request latency, media sequence and actual video PES
presentation timestamps, and rejects sequence gaps, timestamp discontinuities,
HTTP errors or progress gaps beyond budget. It stores numbered media segments,
not raw grant URLs. It rejects unsupported encrypted/fMP4 formats rather than
pretending to validate them. When `packetImage` is supplied, the collector also runs `packet-proof.py` using
the packaged ffprobe in an owned, bounded, network-disabled container. This
demuxes actual packets and fails duplicate/regressing audio or video DTS. The
container's exact ID is captured and cleaned up even on a timeout. Without that
field, `packetTimingVerified` stays false. PTS-only progress is insufficient:
the initial local baseline delivered media but had duplicate/regressing DTS at
an encoder run transition, which this stricter oracle rejects. Independently
generated clean FFmpeg HLS passed the packet oracle. Validate complete decoding
of the collected segments with error-exit behavior as an additional gate. Collector validation
was exercised with real generated FFmpeg TS and a deliberately substituted later
segment: clean media passed and the actual PTS gap failed.

Its summary always says `placementAndFencingVerified: false`: the collector does
not observe execution ownership. To prove the distributed pipeline, capture
independent PG evidence for the exact session/boot/generation in
`placement_sessions`, claims and route tables; map the source owner to the
source node and the encoder target to a different transcode-only node; capture
actual NNTP reads and encoder process/output evidence; and fetch through a
surviving different public node to prove delivery forwarding. A local FFmpeg
start and zero placement rows is local fallback, even if all media decodes.
Never publish raw source grants, bearer tokens, Secret values or full FFmpeg
command lines in these evidence artifacts.

## Controlled loss

Keep source, database, encoder and public delivery identities explicitly mapped
to failure domains. Use `hard-loss.sh` only with a verifier that runs the media
collector across the loss and checks the exact durable placement/generation and
retirement authority. The helper captures a worker container ID together with
its kind authorization labels, operates only on that ID, checks stopped/PID0,
and restores it on exit. Parent authority evidence must establish whether the
exact encoder/source process died; silence or a failed probe cannot retire it.

Measure timestamps before/during/after loss, playback progress, maximum delivery
gap, errors, range/seek behavior, duplicate encoding and durable capacity held
until proof. No successful single-node HLS read or stopped Docker container alone
constitutes seamless node-loss acceptance. Preserve unresolved claims if proof
is missing. Repeat separately for graceful drain, abrupt encoder loss, source
loss and public ingress/controller loss with surviving authority/capacity. Stop
owned port-forwards and verifier children afterward; preserve the explicitly
requested kind lab.

## MediaBrowser delivery aliases

The chart routes `/jellyfin/sessions/media` and `/emby/sessions/media` to the
media Service. Admission, `/Videos/...` and lazy/control routes remain on API.
Returned grant-bearing representation URLs keep the same origin and prefix;
no Ingress path rewrite is required. GET/HEAD and MediaBrowser OPTIONS preflight
requests resolve the current coordinator and replay its original mounted
frontend. Original query and bounded account/device headers are preserved, and
the broker rechecks the path grant, protocol, active viewer and current policy.

`TestMediaBrowserDeliveryReplaysOriginalFrontendAndFencesLoss` compares actual
HTTP responses from standalone mounted frontends with responses through two
stateless delivery senders. It uses the real broker and offline source/encoder
bytes. For each protocol it checks master/media playlists, segments, direct
files, seven grant/account credential envelopes, GET/HEAD/OPTIONS, Range/206/416,
response/security/CORS/cache headers, viewer and policy revocation, wrong grants,
protocol isolation and generation fencing. It closes one delivery listener and
fetches the next segment through the other. This is offline path evidence,
not a physical-node loss or a decoded playback measurement. Repeat these URLs
through the real Ingress and client probe during delivery-node loss; combine
with the durable neutral-session restoration gate for controller loss.


## Release loss matrix and verdicts

Record Plex × {source, transcode, delivery, controller} × {force-delete, pause}
× {startup, steady}. Also record Jellyfin controller and transcode loss, an Emby
baseline, physical second-host pause and native GPU kill with CPU recovery.
Expand Jellyfin action/phase coverage explicitly in the report; do not infer it
from Plex. A baseline is not a loss case. A paused lab node/container is not an
actual physical power cut; state the precise fault domain and surviving database.

Every required case starts PENDING. A case can pass only with a harness report
identifying protocol, session, candidate revision, role/boot/generation, fault
action and timing, and measuring all of the following:

- Zero stalls: the simulated player's forward buffer never empties.
- Every expected segment index fetched exactly once with HTTP 200.
- Strict decode across the splice without errors; PTS discontinuity no greater
  than one frame duration.
- Audio access-unit sequence exact, proven with ordered AU hashes: no duplicate
  or gap. Packet DTS monotonicity alone does not prove this.
- Server interruption below the measured client buffer, with the interruption
  definition and observation interval recorded.
- Independent placement, fencing and retirement observations for the exact
  execution; surviving healthy encoders must not restart on controller loss.

Missing exact-reference checks are UNVERIFIED, even when structural timing and
decode pass. A failed metric is FAIL. An uninjected case stays PENDING with its
blocking reason. A detected stall in a deliberate negative control proves the
oracle detects that fault, not that production recovery passes. Repeat reference
and fault runs on the same reviewed candidate; never combine segment sequences
of different lengths as an exact continuity proof.

The release worker maintains `evidence-index.md` and `evidence-index.json` in its
private BB thread storage. Each row includes role, action, protocol, phase,
session, server interruption, client stalls, segment/PTS/decode/AU checks,
verdict, harness report paths and SHA256s. Unknown metrics are null, never zero.
Supporting baselines, local splice experiments and superseded runs are labeled
separately. Hash the actual report files; a directory name or a worker summary
is not a report digest. Record source revisions and capture times so mutable
reports cannot silently replace the evidence behind a decision. The live index
and private media, credentials, logs and dumps must not be committed.

A later Plex no-loss baseline passes all eight continuity checks against an
independent reference, with no stalls or retries and clean Stop/retirement.
This closes reference readiness for that tested profile. Earlier rejected
references remain historical evidence; loss acceptance still requires its own
completed case report on the reviewed candidate.

A measured Plex source-pod loss also exercises source-owner replacement and
advances the source generation while the encoder generation/node/boot remain
unchanged. Collected media, controls and retirement pass for that steady
single-host pod-fault profile. The earlier attempt that did not exercise source
replacement remains labeled NOT_EXERCISED. Server interruption is unmeasured;
physical-host and other source-loss profiles remain separate gates.

## Multihost lab scripts

`packaging/kubernetes/multihost/` provides an isolated K3s lab across hosts over
Tailscale. These scripts mutate only the explicitly named lab resources; review
private state, exact identities, resource budgets and the real verifier before
running them. They are not production cluster installers.

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `node.sh MODE STATE_DIR EXTERNAL_IP [SERVER_IP]` | Create a bounded, labeled lab K3s container on each host; capture exact container/network IDs and keep token files private |
| `join.sh`, `local-agents.sh` | Join the remote agent or add bounded local agents; local agents remain one physical failure domain |
| `install.sh PRIVATE_STATE IMAGE_TAG` | Install isolated fixtures, trusted inputs and four specialist pools in context `ether035-multihost`, namespace `ether035-ha` |
| `redeploy.sh PRIVATE_STATE INTEGRATION_SHA` | Build/import a reviewed candidate and update OnDelete templates; drain/replace separately |
| `role-loss.sh POD` | Force-delete one captured role pod with zero grace and a UID precondition |
| `role-pause.sh POD VERIFIER [ARGS...]` | Freeze the exact captured Ether task and descendants, run the verifier and restore that task on exit |
| `loss.sh FAULT STATE_DIR PEER_TAILSCALE_IP VERIFIER [ARGS...]` | Fault the captured local lab-node container; partition only its network namespace; restore on exit |
| `remote-loss.py --container-id ID --fault FAULT -- VERIFIER ARGS...` | Fault one captured second-host lab container over authenticated BB terminals and restore; pressure aborts cannot count as completed host-loss cases |
| `pressure-gate.py` | Check sustained second-host memory headroom before starting work |
| `physical-host.values.yaml` | Delivery placement overlay; verify all role placements before interpreting a host fault |
| `relay.sh`, `relay.py`, `external-private.py` | Lab transport for explicitly configured external/private endpoints |
| `teardown.sh PRIVATE_STATE` | Retire only captured owned lab resources after workloads and verifiers finish |

Keep lab reports under thread storage. Run the harness continuously across the
fault and correlate exact Pod UID/container/boot identities before and after.
Capture real physical placement rather than relying on Kubernetes hostnames.
A force-delete is an abrupt-fault experiment, not the normal rollout procedure:
normal updates use [explicit drain and UID-safe replacement](kubernetes.md#drain-upgrade-and-rollback).
Memory pressure checks and restoration outcomes are part of the report; an
infrastructure guard blocking a run leaves its acceptance row PENDING.
