# Offline HLS splice verification

Build `go build ./cmd/splicecheck`. FFmpeg and FFprobe are explicit dependencies
of this offline tool, not new runtime dependencies. Media is never committed.

```
splicecheck -candidate /scratch/spliced -reference /scratch/uninterrupted \
  -boundary 3 -grid 4s -ffmpeg /tools/ffmpeg -ffprobe /tools/ffprobe
```

Directories contain numeric segment filenames and, for fMP4, `init.mp4`.
For generation-specific initialization segments or selected windows, use
`-input artifacts.json` with `Segments` and `Options` matching the exported
`internal/splicecheck` types. `Segment.InitPath` accompanies each `.m4s`.
`Options.SegmentDuration` is a Go duration in nanoseconds in JSON. The library
accepts a caller context and executable paths. Callers own their process timeout.

The verifier accepts clear H264 video and ADTS-representable AAC audio. It checks
the first VCL NAL is IDR, decodes each segment independently, and decodes their
byte concatenation with error-exit behavior. It preserves timestamps rather than
using the concat demuxer's timestamp rebasing. It compares decoded frame PTS and
counts with the reference, checks packet DTS, hashes each raw AAC AU after
stripping ADTS headers/CRC, checks audio packet clocks and checks segment-start
spacing against the grid within one video frame. The terminal partial segment
need not fill a grid slot. Video compression bytes need not equal the reference.

All checks and generation boundaries are JSON serializable. A missing reference
leaves frame-count and AU identity checks false and returns an error: independent
decode and increasing timestamps alone cannot prove absence of omitted media.
An operational error also prevents acceptance. A passing report describes only
its supplied files/window; it supplies no placement, fencing, client buffering,
source identity, database authority or latency evidence.

## Resume contract

A trusted `core.HLSRequest.Resume` names the first segment to regenerate and the
execution generation. Set `StartOffset` to zero. Generation must be nonzero.
The HLS manager keeps the full-title zero-origin grid, disables the fast-start
ramp and starts at `FirstSegment * SegmentDuration`, retaining the original
segment numbers. `-ss` with `-copyts -start_at_zero`, `-start_number N` and forced
keyframes retain that grid. Generation fencing belongs to the cluster consumer,
not the muxer. `temp_file` publication means an unfinished segment is regenerated;
only fully renamed, durably retained segments belong before the splice.

The shared software H264 restart fix preserves the fresh-start TS muxer clock.
`x264FramePlan` selects the encoder's B-frame/pyramid configuration and its decode
reorder depth together. At a TS restart, `-output_ts_offset reorder/fps` restores
the shift that FFmpeg applied to the initial negative DTS. Copied audio is retained
from `ceil(N*d*fps)/fps - reorder/fps`, matching the original TS interleave cutoff. The output
clock uses the demuxer's reference frame rate (or the negotiated output rate),
not a VFR source's average frame rate.

For fMP4, the existing preload is retained. The copied-audio restart cutoff is
`ceil(N*d*outputFPS)/outputFPS + ceil(2e6/sourceFPS)/1e6 - reorder/outputFPS`. For a VFR source the existing builder supplies no preload, so use zero for
that term. The microsecond rounding is
significant: an AU exactly on the nominal boundary can already belong to the
preceding fragment. No AAC bytes are re-encoded or rewritten by this fix.

H264 NVENC uses `nvencFramePlan` to select the preset, explicit B-frame count
and timestamp reorder depth together. The default plan pins `-bf 3`; negotiated
H264 levels retain `-bf 0` and `-refs 1`. FFmpeg's `nvenc_set_timestamp` uses
`frameIntervalP-1` timestamp slots, equal to the configured B-frame count, even
though `has_b_frames` reports 2 for any nonzero count. At 30 fps the default
plan therefore requires a 100 ms TS restart lead; the level plan requires zero.
The zero-reorder TS plan explicitly disables the child muxer's automatic negative
timestamp normalization: a negative copied-audio priming packet would otherwise
shift only the initial run, even though video has no B-frames. This keeps the
clock independent of the input audio's priming duration without changing its AUs.
TS input seeking also opens that far before the requested boundary, rounded down
to milliseconds, so the demuxer retains the required copied AUs. A video `trim`
keeps the authored first frame and its absolute PTS while passing GPU frames
through. The audio bitstream filter still applies the planned cutoff.
The same plan supplies fMP4 audio preload, rounded up to microseconds using the
output frame rate, and the matching audio cut. fMP4 receives no TS mux shift.
This changes neither the software encoder plans nor their historical preload.

Chunked/keyframe-planned runs retain their previous mux clocks and audio cutoffs;
their slotter authors a separate timeline. Both restart correction helpers refuse
those run specifications, including a final chunked run with no remaining KeyTimes.

The measured configurations use copied LC AAC at 48 kHz: libx264, and native
Windows H264 NVENC on an RTX 4080 with pinned FFmpeg 8.1.3 at 30 fps. The NVENC
steady p4 default and level-4.1 plans pass all eight local splice checks at
boundaries 1–4 in TS and fMP4, including original and generation-specific fMP4
initialization segments. These are restart-clock proofs; distributed loss and
client-buffer acceptance remain separate gates. Other hardware encoder reorder
depths, audio re-encoding identity and other video codecs require separate proof. Ordinary video-copy arguments remain
unchanged. Copy-video HLS uses source keyframes: the session timeline snaps to
known keyframes; without a source index the muxer cuts at the next source
keyframe after its requested duration. Such a grid cannot be inferred from N*d;
cluster Resume currently refuses video copy. Normal client copy seeks keep their
existing behavior.

## Reproducing synthetic input arguments

`go build -tags splicelab ./cmd/splicelab` exposes the real argument builder only
in the lab build. Supply `-input`, ffprobe JSON via `-probe`, `-dir`, `-container`
(`mpegts` or `fmp4`) and `-first N`. It prints a JSON argument array, suitable for
an argv-based process runner. `-copy-video` exercises the ordinary remux builder.
Never execute that JSON through a shell. SIGKILL trials must record the exact
owned child, finalized filenames at death and first missing index; a normal
completed encode followed by concatenation does not prove a kill trial.
